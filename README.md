# Simulator Automatic Warehouse

This repository is a thesis project for University of Verona (Universit√† di Verona).\
\
This project allows to simulate an automatic warehouse by inserting some information like: height, weight, etc.\
Furthermore, you can visit a webpage (index.py) to create new simulations in a user-friendly way.\
\
The project is "in progress", so the documentation will come soon...
