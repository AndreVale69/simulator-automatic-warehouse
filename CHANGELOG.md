## [v0.0.1-bachelors-degree-thesis](https://github.com/AndreVale69/simulator-automatic-warehouse/releases/tag/v0.0.1-bachelors-degree-thesis)
- This is an alpha version of the project. It is only made to see how the project was at the start. It corresponds to my bachelor thesis in computer science at the University of Verona. 
  This version should be stable, but it doesn't have any tests (next improvement)! So for now it is not very reliable.
