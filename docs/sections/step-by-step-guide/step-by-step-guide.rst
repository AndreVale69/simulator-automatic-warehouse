Step by step guide
==================

In this section we will explain how to use the Simulator Automatic Warehouse library.

First we will introduce how to create a digitalised Automatic Warehouse (Digital Twin)
and then we will talk about how to run a simulation, how to model it and finally how to save the results.

The guide aims to introduce a new user to the library and explains how to run its first Python code.
