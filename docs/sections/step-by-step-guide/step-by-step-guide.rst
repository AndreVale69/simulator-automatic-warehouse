Step by step guide
==================

In this section we will explain how to use the Simulator Automatic Warehouse library.

First we will introduce how to create a digitalised Automatic Warehouse (Digital Twin)
and then we will talk about how to run a simulation, how to model it and finally how to print the results.

The guide aims to introduce a new user to the library and explains how to run its first Python code.
By the end, you will understand how to use the library and be ready to model your Automatic Warehouse,
customise your Python code and run the simulations.
