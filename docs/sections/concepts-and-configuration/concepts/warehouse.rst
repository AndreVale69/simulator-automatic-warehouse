Warehouse
=========

The Warehouse is the entire environment of the Simulator and the Digital Twin.

By this term we mean the warehouse itself.
It contains **everything** and that's why in the Simulator Automatic Warehouse is the main object used to represent the Digital Twin.
It is also the basis for the simulation.

The case study used to build this library is the `Ferretto Vertimag <https://www.ferretto.com/soluzione/magazzini-automatici-verticali-vertimag/>`_ (as you can see in the picture).
