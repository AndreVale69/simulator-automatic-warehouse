Concepts

The Simulator Automatic Warehouse aims to simulate a real Automatic Vertical Storage System.
But to understand a simulator it is very important to understand also the digitalised system.

In this section we will introduce you to the digital twin created to build the library.
If you already have this industrial machine, these concepts may be familiar to you.
However, we **strongly recommend** that you read this section to understand how each class was built and how the
simulator works under the hood.
This section might explain to you some tricky operations that the end user doesn't see at all (again, under the hood).
