Containers
==========

By *container* we mean the physical element that can contain a set of trays and materials inside them.

In the library you will find a class called ``TrayContainer``.
This is a superclass that is used as an abstract class.
So you should instantiate it, but you must implement its children (``Column`` and ``Carousel``).
