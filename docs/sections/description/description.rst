The Simulator Automatic Warehouse is a Python library that provides two main functions:
a `digital twin <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin>`_ of an automatic warehouse and a simulator
of an automatic warehouse.

What is an Automatic Warehouse?
-------------------------------

An Automatic Warehouse, or rather an Automatic Vertical Storage System,
is a storage system designed to simplify the storage of materials.
It is generally used in industrial environments and is designed according to the *goods-to-man* principle:
the products are brought directly to the picking area (called bay).

---------------
How it was born
---------------

This repository was created in 2022 for a bachelor thesis project at the University of Verona, Italy
(Universit√† di Verona).
After the creator graduated, he continued to improve the project in order to publish it.

The inspiration came from the `Vertimag <https://www.ferretto.com/en/solutions/vertical-lift-modules-vertimag/>`_
by `Ferretto <https://www.ferretto.com/en/>`_, an Italian company based in Vicenza.
The logic of the digitalized warehouse is therefore the same as that of the real Vertimag.

The digitisation of the warehouse was made possible thanks to the `ICE Laboratory <https://www.icelab.di.univr.it/>`_
of Verona, as part of a thesis project at the University of Verona.
In addition, `Sebastiano Gaiardelli <https://sbgaia.github.io/>`_ (mainly) and
`Marco Panato <https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-panato-vr>`_ helped the creator at the beginning of the project.
