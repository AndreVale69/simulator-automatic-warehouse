The Simulator Automatic Warehouse requires ``Python >= 3.9`` and the tests are performed on Ubuntu, Windows and MacOS.

Python 3.8 is no longer supported, as Python will end support on 2024-10.

It's possible to install the package using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install simulator-automatic-warehouse

We **strongly recommend** this method.
